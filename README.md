# Project1


## Purpose
This project asked us to create a website that would use various Javascript, CSS and HTML elements to solve a real-world problem with a design that integrates data from multiple API calls. In brainstorming the open-ended assignment, we realized that all of us "Varistas" enjoyed drinking coffee, and would be happy to visit a digital coffeeshop that would help use learn about different coffee-based beverages, find local cafes and help us decide if we needed another coffee or had already over-caffeinated ourselves.


## Coding Process and Obstacles
We started out by using pen and paper to model the finished product's basic layout and functionality. From there, we made a html wireframe with Bulma's css classes which we then broke off to focus on the Javascript code that would enable users to interact with our three main features: search local cafes, take a caffeine intake quiz and learn about a random coffee-based beverage. Finally, we added custom styling with a coffee-centric tan and brown color scheme, placed some visual touches on the page including a beautiful quote and a footer crediting our team.

The biggest challenges our team encountered were using Google's Place and Geocoding API's for the local cafes feature. The documentation for these API's did not employ the standard fetch/response logic for API calls, so we needed to do some additional research and experimentation. Our team also had some early difficulties gettings used to the various Git operations: pulling and pushing, working in the develop branch, etc.

## Future developments
Our team has some ideas for improving the user experience with this web application. One goal would be to further stylize the Coffee Drink Library to modify the display of the images, making them have equal sizing and uniform borders. Additionally, we can expand the search for local coffeeshop functionality to accept inputs other than zip codes, such as city names or user location.

## Credits
We used various free internet resources as reference for syntax and general ideas, including substack, w3schools and MDN library. But all of the code itself came from the Hearts and Minds of MinhThu, Kalina, Austin, and Brian.
