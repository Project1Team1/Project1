# Project1

## Purpose
This project asked us to create a website that would use various Javascript, CSS and HTML elements to solve a real-world problem with a design that integrates data from multiple API calls. In brainstorming the open-ended assignment, we realized that all of us "Varistas" enjoyed drinking coffee, and would be happy to visit a digital coffeeshop that would help use learn about different coffee-based beverages, find local cafes and help us decide if we needed another coffee or had already over-caffeinated ourselves.
